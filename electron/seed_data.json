      "notes_raw": "ENTRY: Saw clear bubble absorption with a small CVD absorption divergence 5sec afterwards. Entered after the sellers took control by selling through bid placed below and staying below that bid, this was a very clear entry signal, once again I did enter a little to late, it took me about 10-15sec to decide to get in, so that needs to get better. The bubble absorption was more clear than last trade, however, this was the clearest entry signal I've ever gotten, and it worked out pretty well. Also I was patiently watching it chewing through passive bids and then moving below that price, so I knew I could stay in for a while, I did move to BE after it chew through the second clear LIQline. This trade was more based on the upper end of the newly formed HVN.\n\nEXIT: 1 contract partials at 24692.00;24687.75;24696.50 (combined=24692.00). The partial taking didn't go that well, this was because I was still finding my way around Tradovate. I just used the market button, after trailing to BE I exited a contract around the first LIQline hurdle. Afterwards I trailed my SL behind a high with resistive LIQ below, then trailed at downwards resistive LIQ, this execution was not very well in general I found. I should always take out at least 1 contract at the 3RR point I think, however, Tradovate is very hard to know the exact RR because you need to calculate it in your head constantly, so I'll need to get better with that. Overall good trade though, good location, clear entry, good trailing, mediocre/bad partials.\n\nMISTAKE: The exit price isn't correct, and the dollar represents my mistake with this trade. I made a mistake with the ATM bracket trade, I exited manually out of the position but the bracket bought back 3, when I only had 1 left, meaning I got in a long with 2 contracts. Very bad mistake, I got lucky that price reversed and went to the upside so hard, because this position didn't even have a SL.",

This caused for an extremely bad entry. Like a 10pt too high kinda entry. Also, I went in with way way too much risk ($170), I should've calculated the risk in pts better in my head to know I should've only risked 2contracts.\n\nEXIT: Was confident it was going up so moved SL to BE after it showed follow-through the 982.50 area, good thing I did. Also, this entry was very early in the session, so I'm not sure I should've taken it, however, the HTF buying zone was my decision trigger.

There isn't really bubble absorption, I think the reason I got in is because I saw selling at the low (not enough/a lot though), then price moved up and chewed through a tiny LIQline of offers, then I hesitated for like 10sec and only then I entered, at the literal most bad price I could've gotten in. Also, again, I went in with double the risk because I reentered the same trade 1 minute after the last trade, so maybe also don't take the exact same trade within the same minute.\n\nEXIT: After price chewed through the bid LIQline and slightly consolidated below it, I should've pulled the trigger to get out. But got stopped out, placing my SL 2pts under the lower end of the LIQline. Deserved this loss, but definitely don't retake the same trade to fast after each other and look for clear absorption and close the trade if it shows immediate bad signs.

This time I went in with better risk, 3 contracts, I entered after it pushed price above the offer LIQline, sadly my quick reaction got me an entry that was 5pts to high for what i think would be ideal. First a little sweat creation after the pullback, but it got absorbed and pushed higher.\n\nEXIT: Everthing looked good but after a second retest of 975 area it just started dropping like crazy, I luckily moved my SL to BE because I didn't want to see price getting back after the initiated buying follow-through of the offers. Got stopped out at BE. The entry could be better this trade, but for the rest I think I managed it quite well.\n\nMISSED TRADE: Sadly this trade was BE, and at 9:49 the real move which I was looking for happened, this sucks because that trade was exactely what I was looking for, it showed all the right signs, it was just below my buying area (950-930), meaning I should probably be less rigid with these zones + they were draw kinda confusing and it was very close to another area and it was at the shelf of a distrubution on yesterdays profile. So I should've propably tried to take it again, but I was kinda scared because I already tried 3 times before, with 2BEs and one Loss.",

Got in, again, at maybe the worst price possible. I was just waiting for the follow-through the bids lower, however, I didn't take into account how low my entry would be.\n\nEXIT: Then price luckily, after a sweaty pullback, got lower to 25070 but then I saw absorption and follow-through above the offer, which should've been my exit trigger, but once again only trailed it to above the highs.\n\nCONCLUSION: I should only get in when the absorption/exhaustion signal is extremely clear and then enter quickly so I don't get the worst price possible. If I'm in a bad trade, I should be extremely alert that I get out at the first signs of the opposite side (buyers in this case) to take control again, cut the trade early for a smaller loss than normal, think of Xyzee.",

I should've given my SL way more breathing room, because, definitely this time, I got a good entry on price, I could've given it at least 2.5pts above the absorption high. Definitely given the context of the move, huge move up, in my potential reversal area, has been kinda shoppy and wicky for the past 30min, so I should've just given it more breathing room. Because, the actual trade idea worked out eventually, even the TP was correct, I just didn't give it enough breathing room, I can be tighter with my SL in maybe a consolidation, but in this case I can place it at a price where if it hit it, it would probably signal another breakout higher. Also after the sellers absorption lower, I should've taken out at least 1 and moved to BE or what I mentioned earlier, if I'm feeling more ballsy.\n\nCONCLUSION: If other side takes over, it should consolidate more than 5s above or below bids/offers, to confirm the other side has retaken control. Also, if in the potential reversal area, with wicky consolidation, give the trade extra breathing room, definitely if you have a good entry. Place it where you think it would confirm a breakout higher/lower out of the current consolidation.",

Now in hindsight, I would 3.000.000% retake this trade. I should hang this example on my wall. However, the context was a little worse this time. Underside of the P-profile, but it has consolidated for 1hour already and the CVD was kinda going crazy.\n\nEXIT: I should've gotten out at the 57 price level, because the sellers took control again and there was more LIQ to the downside. However, my dumb dumb stayed in the trade and suffered the 3min long excruciating consequences. I think I stayed in the trade way longer because I was hoping the LIQline would be another absorption point, which it was and gave almost the exact same entry signal afterwards, but looking back I should've already been out of the trade.\n\nCONCLUSION: When price goes up a lot, and then consolidates, you can only long at the beginning of that HVN creation, don't do it after 1hour! Instinct needs to be to short the upper side of it. Also, if my target is not large (smaller RR), then I can get more eager to get out earlier! As in, give trades in general more breathing room and if the other selling/buying aggressors take over again, you can get out \"earlier\".\n\nEXTRA: I kinda lost track of the plot and actually should've been looking to take a short from the underside of the P-profile shelf, because this was my original trade idea, but i was once again too zoomed in on my own failing trade.",

Was aiming for 5pts before the huge LIQline at 25.000.\n\nEXIT: This is where it went bad, I was only planning to take out 1 contract, however, I accidentally left the ATM bracket on + I clicked on the \"exit at market & close\", which means that it closes all the positions and limits you have on the screen, even when you only have 1 contract selected on the contract amount selection. Meaning I prob missed out on a solid 3-4RR because of, again, not fully knowing the trading platform. I should keep this in mind for the future.\n\nEXTRA: I missed a bunch of trades (like 2-3) based on the current session volume profile (CSVP), lot's of mean reverting trade which would've netted me a lot, but I was just a little hesitant on all of them and would've gotten a bad entry on most if not all of them, so I guess it's better than yesterday, where I was way too trigger happy.",

I need to overthink a little less, as in, do the thinking/conceive the trade idea with all it components before entering it, so when I see the clear entry trigger, I get in.\n\nEXIT: Saw serious CVD absorption, however, it felt like the buyers were only barely in control and decided that if there was consolidation under 25.121,50 after a buy bubble, I was putting my SL to BE because it prob wouldn't have worked out and would go hit my SL.\n\nGood trade idea, hesitant entry, good SL placement, but most important extremely well trade management.",

Then the second exit, again, was in a pullback, which wasn't good this time because it was just me being scared not to have any profits, as in, there was little reason to get out where I did, I also was originally planning to get out above the highs where people would've put there short term stops, which it did do, but I got scared in the pullback and got out 1 contract :(. Then for the last contract I trailed out very aggressively at the current POC.\n\nOverall, good trade idea, execution, bad management this time, in hindsight a very good overall exit too.

It had absorption but then shortly went above it, then shortly below it and then back above it. This is not clear at all. Definitely because the move below wasn't even bubble or CVD divergence absorption, it was a big green buyer, so no sellers were really stuck or exhausted. Also the move up created a CVD buying absorption, which should have been my trigger to get out, but I didn't really look at the CVD this session that much. My TP was the next POI-area. My SL was better this time (as in more breathing room)\n\nLESSON: Don't enter on mixed signals, and if I'm unsure, immediately look for a reason to get out the trade, look at CVD the other side taking control by moving above/below offers/bids. Then just cut the trade early or move SL to BE if possible.\n\nALSO: I just missed a lot of trades today in general. I should probably look back at price when it slightly doesn't go into a LIQline and see if there is a way that I can get into that trade, with at least half of my position at first, so if it fails I lose 0,5RR, but if it moves in my direction I could add and be at 1RR and have a potential 3RR+ trade.

Also, this session in general was just weird, good trade, good trade ideas, but it was very wicky and was moving extremely fast (30M opening range was ~200pt). I got lucky price immediately moved in my direction, I was able to cleanly partial out of it too, I was a little hesitant for every trail because it wasn't moving as fast down like it was moving upwards the past 30min, so I probably, in hindsight, could've gone for my original target of 865. My entry was primarily based on the consolidation under the stuck buyers and leaving them at the top under water after the fast move downwards after (look at CVP) and was able to place my stop not at the high but already lower, under the big selling move downwards. I then partialed at signs of weakness and at the absorbed lows around 885 I cut the full trade, wich was the short term low, but however, with my entry at the top I could've just stayed in it, but my thinking was that it was prob going to test the POI(945-970) again, so I coudl reenter, this sadly, didn't happen.\n\nLESSON: This is an example of the HTF POI being good enough after seeing \"weaker\" absorption as a signal entry to enter the trade. Good management, but I should create more balls to keep at least 1 contract on with SL at BE to see how low it can go. I should also think, SL to BE, so if it comes back to the entry, it might give me another entry, meaning I should just give the trailing SL more breathing room and if it does trail me out, just have another go at it, because the HTF POI is well chosen.",

Perfect trade idea, perfect absorption, was sitting on my hands for the past 1,25h, then took it with a SL way to tight, definitely according to how good the HTF POI was and got stopped out. The immediately afterwards my gut was screaming me to get in (look at CVP) but I wanted another entry signal, which actually did come, however, I just didn't pull the trigger because I was incredibly unsure where to put my SL. Also the anxiety that it make me feel because there was a fat LIQline at 670 lower, still untouched where I would've preferred to get in at but that never happened. This trade made me so close to crashing out, because I prob would've made ~$800 aiming for the POC (if I went in with 3 contracts). \n\nLESSON: Have a big enough SL, if needed go in with smaller size to still capture the move and if you get a reentry, get in immediately and put your stop at the low where you missed the first entry! Put SL 5 pts below/above the underside/upperside of the bid/offer that got absorbed.\n\nPlease Trader, don't make me feel this pain again, this failing at the individual trade but it working out immediately after is prob the worst feeling in trading, torturous.

Looked very bad at first and would've been stopped out if I put my SL at the high, so I learned from my previous mistake. Trade was incredibly sweaty at first until I saw exhaustion of price, as in, CVD divergence + it only took a little bit of the LIQline and big heavy accelerated selling happened after that. Looked extremely good at first, however after buyers took back over by consolidating above the offers at 932, I decided to place my SL at BE, which was extremely management by me, if I may say so myself. TP was  right before a massive LIQline of bids right before the dropoff in volume of the current session profile.\n\nLESSON: Listen to my tips of having a bigger SL and managing the position by moving SL to BE after the other side takes over again. This trade is how I should've traded the whole day and I would stand a lot better than I was right now (for the day).\n\nSIDENOTE: After this I noticed how price kinda avoided hitting LIQlines (980 and 890, very irratating), as if it was rotating price right before hitting it to the other side on purpose. My current hypothesis of why it happened is that it was lunch time so there aren't enough big players to push or get absorbed at those LIQlines, therefore they were getting avoided in general, I should look back in time to see if this happens a lot at lunch time, because it could give me an extra little edge at this time of day.",

This day was not clear at all, it has a range of 200pts, BUT ITS MOVING SO FUCKING SLOWLY, it was disrespecting all and everything, I have a feeling I didn't have to leave my SL with as much margin as I did the week previously, because then it was ultra volatile and now it is not at all anymore.

I saw heavy CVD buying absorption also so that was another reason to definitely get short. Was kinda scared because it already went down like 100pts but I told myself this weekend that when I think the move is ending and I want to start catching knives, the move won't be done yet so I should get with the downwards momentum, which worked today :). It was a sweaty trade at first, it had a little breakout of the small range so I put my SL behind the LVN of the HVN of that range, trailed out the first around 10pts, second at around 500 and the third at 480, the last at the other round number and got trailed out when it came back into a range, which it therefore went higher afterwards. Good trade, good new rule following, and good management. Happy Trader.",

      "notes_raw": "Was waiting for the IB to finish to know what bias to take, it looked like it was going lower, however, there was a ton of LIQ around 500 (like 3 lines of 20+) I was waiting for exhaustive CVD divergence to take it higher, however, it took it but it got heavily absorbed. For some reason even though I previously would've taken it lower my subconscious was screaming to take it higher, I was just waiting for a little extra confirmation in the pullback, which sadly didn't happen, however, my instinct was 100% correct but I didn't get in.\nThis set up my thought process for the actual trade because the whole move lower failed, meaning, it will prob go higher (spoiler: it did). I'm really proud that I didn't chase and waited for the trade/another opportunity. The actual move I took was a reclaim of the LVN with massive LIQlines at the consolidation lows. It got massively absorped, which the consolidation happening afterwards was my entry. However, looking back I could've had an even better confirmation because about 70 offers got filled, which made it very bullish. Also the SL could be very tight that's why I was willing to risk half of my profit of the day. The trailing went quite smooth, however, in hindsight I regret not setting TP2 further away and TP3 at the [VWAP+600+POC] (yes all these things were at the same price, that's why I regret not risking the TP3 a little higher). The last trail-out was perfect though, didn't look like it in the moment but it was the best decision because afterwards it reversed.\n\nConclusion: Waiting for the move is better than trying to catch the knife. Looking at LIQlines that only have 20+ contracts makes the waiting much easier. Only entering when everything is very clear is a blessing for my mental. Also, knowing that I can always just wait for the pullback (+I can rethink the move/think a little longer), makes me not chase the move anymore, which is a fantastic thing.",

      "notes_raw": "Trade based on the fact that the past weeks there is an enormous chance that the open just sends us one direction and keeps going that way. So when it approached 400, fast, I was rather looking for shorts if it took that LIQ, which it did. Once price takes LIQ I prefer to take the same direction because it most of the time goes to at least around 20pts in my favor, which is enough for 1-2TPs to be hit, making it either a -0.5RR trade or BE  trade, therefore, I was willing to give it a try. I saw sellers getting absorbed and right afterwards follow-through the offers, which kinda makes it look more like a long, but the context didn't say long and right after it took it it consolidated below those offers for a while which was my trigger. Put my SL far enough because of those offers and just tried to get into the selling momentum, which worked. My first TP should've been a bit lower, around 385 and my second TP should've also been 10pts lower at 362, not 370 but price was moving very fast. The 3rd partial was perfect at 300 and then my trail was also perfect at 311.5 (about 10pts above the LIQline of 300) because afterwards it rallied higher. I trailed super tight also because I was up about 4RR already and didn't want to give too much away.\n\nConclusion: The closer to the open I take a trade, if the past weeks show very one-directional moves, I want to be with the momentum and not try to catch the move. Also, context is important! Moreover, when price takes a round number of LIQ, prefer to take it into that direction, don't catch the knife or it would need to scream at me with the correct context.",

I missed the short that made this move downwards, however, how much it hurt I followed my rules and didn't chase it with a bad entry. I was also preferring longs, but it was not giving a substantial pullback until now, I really wanted to get in the trade so the slightest good entry signal I got at the STDEV1 VWAP got me in. However the moves were so big that my SL was larger than 15pts (it was 17,5pts) which made me really not want to lose the trade but I remembered i was up $1000 on the week and just had to risk it. It was a very sweaty pullback to 70, however the supportive bid made my SL safe and my mental a bit easier. This time it was also sweatier because I placed my 2nd TP a lot further, which I dared because of the relentless buying. Got a pretty much perfect 2nd and 3rd partial, the last partial I was going to take off if price got absorbed around 80, which it did, but I hesitated and just trailed my SL to 60 and got stopped out. Sadly, I shouldn't have trailed my SL so much if I knew the buying was relentless because it just kept going up, after hitting my SL it went 200pts further, so, sucks to suck I guess. On another day I would've placed the SL perfect, but today was more special (600pt move upwards in <2h). \n\nOverall good trade though, let's size up a little next week and see where it takes me. Hyped and scared, because I feel like I made a little breakthrough by focusing on big bids and offers (>20pts) and being more patient, but I feel that I might also be getting lucky, which doesn't feel nice, but we'll see next week.",

Saw price chewing through 700s, so waited for a pullback and immediately saw supportive bids, so I entered. The support immediately got pulled, however, I finally got in a really good entry I think, sadly in hindsight it doesn't look like that anymore.

Scary because it went against me and stopped right before SL, luckily it then started chewing through LIQ above and I could place my SL to 691,50, for a more comfortable SL. Then it happened, it just kept going up, so I took out most of my original position for less than $100, however, every time I exited (so right before LIQ), if it took the LIQ convincingly, I reentered on the pullback/at the LIQline, and I did this 5 times and just trailed my SL to where made sense at the time (10pts behind supportive LIQ) and got stopped out after finally seeing some slowdown on the tape. In hindsight I was too zoomed in and could've gotten more out of the trade.\n\nA few observation: \n1) If it is a trend upwards, there is a lower chance to have a V-shape reversal, meaning that I should wait to get fully out of the trade after it starts to consolidate (real consolidation in upwards trend is to make 3 highs around the same period), TP at the midpoint of that consolidation of the shelf of the upper side, also move SL behind the LVN under the consolidation HVN. This will prob indicate either a time for longer consolidation or reversal or maybe a smaller leg up, which won't be worth it.\n2) If everything looks good and looks like a trend maybe trying to add at the beginning is ideal, so after taking out 2 contracts, maybe start adding 2 in again at the start and afterwards only 1 or something like that because now it was 2 on, 1 off, then 1 on again (so now 2) and repeating that pattern the whole time. However, adding this much at the start might just be me looking at hindsight.\n3) (thanks to Pax) The market looks to be moving in ~65handle swings, so maybe place my TPs more around those areas or only add if it goes above that.

Therefore, if it took LIQ, I should be Long and not against the trend. I saw price chewing through the 700s, waited for a pullback, and immediately saw supportive bids, so I entered.\n\nThe support immediately got pulled. However, I thought I finally got a really good entry; sadly, in hindsight, it doesn't look that way anymore. I could place my SL far enough to avoid being stopped out.

This means I should wait to exit the trade fully after it starts to consolidate. Real consolidation in an upward trend involves making three highs around the same period. I should set my TP at the midpoint of that consolidation, specifically the shelf on the upper side, and move my SL behind the LVN under the consolidation's HVN. This will probably indicate either a longer consolidation, a reversal, or perhaps a smaller leg up, which wouldn't be worth it.\n2.  If everything looks good and signals a trend, trying to add at the beginning might be ideal. For example, after taking out two contracts, perhaps add two back in at the start, and then only one afterwards. My current pattern was two on, one off, then one on again (back to two), repeating that throughout. However, adding this much at the start might just be hindsight bias.\n3.  (Thanks to Pax) The market appears to be moving in approximately 65-handle swings. Therefore, I should consider placing my TPs more around those areas or only adding if price goes above that range. I'm not 100% certain about this, so I need to verify it or keep it in mind for future trades.\n\nConclusion: I am 3000% better at managing a trade than getting into one.",

      "notes_clean": "Fresh off a significant profit from a prior long MNQ trade, I had substantial capital available and impulsively decided to attempt catching a falling knife. I did, and I was clearly not in the correct mindset. This is crucial: attempting to catch a falling knife on MNQ *must* only be done at a High Timeframe Point of Interest (POI). This particular trade was driven purely by instinct; MNQ felt overextended, and there was aggressive selling pressure pushing through the bids. I should absolutely not have been in this MNQ trade, and certainly not with this significant size. Furthermore, my Stop Loss was positioned too far. I probably should have waited to observe MNQ's price action at the key liquidity level at 921.\n\nConclusion: Just like the previous trade, DO NOT attempt to catch a falling knife on MNQ. If, however, you insist on attempting it, restrict such endeavors to a High Timeframe POI where MNQ begins to consolidate, showing signs such as three consecutive higher lows, indicating a potential bottom after the preceding downward trend.",
